"* AWS Pricing Calculator provides only an estimate of your AWS fees and doesn't include any taxes that might apply. Your actual fees depend on a variety of factors, including your actual usage of AWS services.",,,,,,,,
Rationale for changes: Our increased budget allows us to improve the performance of the application by modifying the Database class to db.m6g.8xlarge and provisioned IOPS of 20000. The number of Web Server and Application server was set to 6 for each autoscaling group. The Web Server and the Application Server classes were set to m4.4xlarge and m5.4xlarge respectively. ,,,,,,,,
