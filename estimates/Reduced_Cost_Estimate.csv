"Rationale for changes: We decided to reduce performance in favor of cost reduction by resizing our web server and application server auto scaling groups to have a maximum of 2 servers. At the same time we modified the class of the DB to a db.m6g.xlarge, whereas the Web Server and Application Server classes were changed to m4.large and m5.xlarge respectively.",,,,,,,,
